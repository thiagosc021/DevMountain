// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values
    of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in whick the end goal is to understands what features will need to be developed and how they supposed to work and interact"
const design ="Third step in the process, here is when the layout of the new features is going to be defined"
const implementation="Fourth step, the implementation step is when you start properly coding the features"
const testingAndIntegration="after you finish coding you need to make sure the new feature you develop matches the requirements and doesn't break anything previously built in the aplication"
const maintain="application code is in constant evolution, new features are added, bugs are fixed, requirements updated, etc... maintainance is the last and very important phase of software development"
